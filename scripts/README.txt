An old version of the .emacs file was still in the Babel2 release.
Please find an improved .emacs file in this folder.
Choose the correct file for your operating system and adapt the paths to slime, ccl and slime-extensions at the start of the file.
Next, overwrite your existing .emacs file with this file.
