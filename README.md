# AIPP Final Project

For the final assignment, you can choose between three projects. These are described later on in this document. For each project, we provide an initial proposal, but there is plenty of room for your own ideas and contributions and additional content. We do encourage this!

On the practical side, we note that you **do not** have to deliver a report of your project. Instead, during the exam, you will give an **oral presentation** of your project. The deadline of your project is **15th of January 2019**. This is one week before the oral exam. You **do not** have to submit your presentation together with the project itself, so you can still work on your presentation between the deadline of the project and the exam date. The exam itself takes place on **22th of January, 2019**. Time slots have been made available in the calendar application on Canvas.

During the exam, you will get **15min** to present your project and **15min** of questions. During this presentation, we expect you to briefly sketch the context of your project. Afterwards, explain your approach, motivate your decisions and interpret your results. Feel free to highlight your own contributions or additional content you added. You will receive questions on your project itself and how you can position the project within the broader scope of the course.

Please notify us of your choice of project **as soon as possible**, especially when using the Nao robot. If you have questions about any of the projects or any of the Babel2 frameworks you want to use, do not hesitate to **send an e-mail** or **make an appointment**. Now, we introduce the project proposals.

## Robot Colour Naming Game

In this project, you will implement a grounded colour naming game using the Nao robot. The agents in your experiment will experience the scene from the same perspective. They will use prototypes to represent the colours of the objects they see. 

**Additional content:**

 - Make it easy to follow the interactions of your experiment by using the Babel2 web-interface.
 - Use additional Babel2 frameworks such as action-behaviour-framework, meta-layer-learning or tasks-and-processes.
 - Implement perceptual deviation, using 2 Nao robots.
 - Enable the use of more features, such as width, height, x- and y-position, etc.

## Flexible Word Meanings

Go beyond single-word-single-meaning games and implement the flexible word meaning experiments, both in a simulated setting (based on Chapter 6) and a grounded setting (based on Chapter 10). For the latter, you will again use the QRIO data.

**Additional content:**

 - Make it easy to follow the interactions of your experiment by using the Babel2 web-interface.
 - Use additional Babel2 frameworks such as action-behaviour-framework, meta-layer-learning or tasks-and-processes.

## Procedural Semantics for QRIO data

Explore procedural semantics and implement a number of primitive operations in IRL. Both the ontology and names of primitive operations will be given. These primitives should work on the QRIO data. With these primitives, you must be able to execute an IRL program on a scene. Also, you must be able to find a discriminating IRL program for a topic, using the IRL composer. Implement an evaluation system that will test this for all scenes in the dataset.

**Additional content:**

 - Make it easy to follow your evaluation system by using the Babel2 web-interface.
