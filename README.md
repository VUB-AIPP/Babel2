# Babel2

Babel2 connects the implementations of our core technologies such as [Fluid Construction Grammar](www.fcg-net.org) and Incremental Recruitment Language (IRL) with mechanisms for multi-agent interactions, robotic embodiment, cognitive processing and learning. An extensive monitoring system gives access to every detail of Babel2â€™s intermediate representations and dynamics and a high modularity ensures that the system can be used in a very wide variety of scenarios.

## Installation

Babel2 is written completely in Common Lisp and has been tested with these Lisp implementations:

 - [Clozure Common Lisp (CCL)](https://ccl.clozure.com)
 - [Steel Banks Common Lisp (SBCL)](http://www.sbcl.org)
 - [LispWorks](http://www.lispworks.com) (everything but Personal Edition)

Other dependencies are:

 - [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info)
 - [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org)

Fully automatic installation scripts are provided for both [Linux](https://emergent-languages.org/Babel2/script.html) and [Mac OS](https://emergent-languages.org/Babel2/script.html). These scripts use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install a Lisp implementation, the necessary requirements and an editor (Emacs with [SLIME](https://github.com/slime/slime)).
