# Babel2

Babel2 connects the implementations of our core technologies such as [Fluid Construction Grammar](www.fcg-net.org) and Incremental Recruitment Language (IRL) with mechanisms for multi-agent interactions, robotic embodiment, cognitive processing and learning. An extensive monitoring system gives access to every detail of Babel2â€™s intermediate representations and dynamics and a high modularity ensures that the system can be used in a very wide variety of scenarios.

Babel2 is written in Common Lisp and runs in most major Lisp implementations ([CCL](https://ccl.clozure.com), [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org) and [LispWorks (excluding Personal Edition)](http://www.lispworks.com)) on all major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows). Its source code is frequently released to the public under the Apache 2.0 License. We recommend using the [Emacs editor with SLIME](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/Emacs-with-Lisp) or [Sublime Text with additional packages](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/Sublime-Text-with-Lisp) for Babel development.

The best place for Babel2 and FCG discussion is [the mailing list](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/Mailing-List). 

## Installation

### Mac OS X or Linux

Installation scripts are provided for both [Linux](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/Installation-Script) and [Mac OS](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/Installation-Script). These scripts will install all necessary tools for you to get started with Babel2 development.

### Windows

Currently, we do not have an installation script for Windows. This is work in progress. For now, you will have to set up a Lisp environment yourself. You can install everything manually in [Windows](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/Windows-Installation), or use a [Virtual Machine](https://github.com/EvolutionaryLinguisticsAssociation/Babel2/wiki/VM-Installation).

## Getting Started

A good starting point for learning Fluid Construction Grammar is the article "Basics of Fluid Construction Grammar" by Luc Steels, published in _Constructions and Frames_. You can download a draft of the article [here](https://www.fcg-net.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/basics-of-fcg.pdf). The web demonstration that supports the article is available [here](https://www.fcg-net.org/demos/basics-of-fcg/).

We regularly organise tutorials on Babel2. Please check [our events page](http://fcg-net.org/events).
